Description: simple wrapper to make dpkg faster (and unsafe)
 This package's purpose is to trade safety for execution speed in
 operations of _dpkg_ (and any program it may execute) by using
 eatmydata to disable disk synchronization calls. This is useful in
 situations where data loss in case of a power outage is not a
 concert, e.g. in setting up ephemeral chroot environments for
 building Debian packages.
 .
 Do not use in production environments where you might care about data
 integrity!
